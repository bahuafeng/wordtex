\subsection*{This is a subsection}


\section{This is a numbered section}


\subsection{And a numbered subsection}

some text


\subsection{And another numbered}

more text

\begin{lstlisting}
This is some code
let's see how it handles special characters
!@#$%^&*())_{}[]<p> another paragraph? </p>

double space!
\end{lstlisting}


Now let's see if we can do some fancy lists
\begin{itemize}
\item simple list
\item not doing much...

\begin{itemize}
\item oh! Now I indented
\item Let's see what happpens again

\begin{itemize}
\item INDENTED again
\end{itemize}
\item and then unintnted
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
it keeps wanting to go back

now it stopped

the line after the items looks wierd on here
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ok numbered list
\item and...

\begin{enumerate}
\item indented
\item how does it look?
\end{enumerate}
\item pretty good..
\end{enumerate}
done?

yep, I guess done


\section{Ok, now tables.}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
Simple table & Doing nothing & to it\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
first col, second row & col 2 & col 3\tabularnewline
\hline 
nothing else here &  & \tabularnewline
\hline 
 &  & \tabularnewline
\hline 
 &  & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}

and more complex table:

\begin{tabular}{|>{\raggedright}p{3cm}||>{\raggedright}p{5cm}||>{\raggedright}p{2cm}|}
\hline 
r1c1 width 3 & r1c2 width 5 & r1c3 width 2\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
These automatically wrap really well & \textbf{Also, lists:}
\begin{itemize}
\item This is a simple list
\item I can write some things that are much longer.
\item It looks really good.\end{itemize}
 & nothing else here at the moment.\tabularnewline
